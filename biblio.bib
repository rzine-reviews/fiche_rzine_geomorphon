	abstract = {We introduce a novel method for classification and mapping of landform elements from a DEM based on the principle of pattern recognition rather than differential geometry. At the core of the method is the concept of geomorphon (geomorphologic phonotypes) — a simple ternary pattern that serves as an archetype of a particular terrain morphology. A finite number of 498 geomorphons constitute a comprehensive and exhaustive set of all possible morphological terrain types including standard elements of landscape, as well as unfamiliar forms rarely found in natural terrestrial surfaces. A single scan of a DEM assigns an appropriate geomorphon to every cell in the raster using a procedure that self-adapts to identify the most suitable spatial scale at each location. As a result, the method classifies landform elements at a range of different spatial scales with unprecedented computational efficiency. A general purpose geomorphometric map — an interpreted map of topography — is obtained by generalizing allgeomorphons to a small number of the most common landform elements. Due to the robustness and high computational efficiency of the method high resolution geomorphometric maps having continental and even global extents can be generated from giga-cell DEMs. Such maps are a valuable new resource for both manual and automated geomorphometric analyses. In order to demonstrate a practical application of this new method, a 30m cell−1 geomorphometric map of the entire country of Poland is generated and the features and potential usage of this map are briefly discussed. The computer implementation of the method is outlined. The code is available in the public domain.},

For the analyses, some of the most famous and frequent hiking destinations in Slovakia and two different DEM resolutions were selected. For both tested methods and DEM resolutions, we applied various settings to evaluate the most suitable ones. Consequently, we assessed accuracy of the landform extraction against a dataset of spot heights from topographic maps and evaluated to which degree such maps reflect the terrain itself. In conclusion, results of this study could present contribution not only for geomorphologists but also for the general public by providing different perception of the surrounding landscape from general paper maps when hiking or walking in mountains.},

	abstract = {Techniques and issues are considered surrounding the characterisation of surface form represented by Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A set of software tools suitable for use in a raster based Geographical Information System (GIS) is developed. Characterisation has three specific objectives, namely to identify spatial pattern, to identify scale dependency in form and to allow visualisation of results. An assessment is made of the characteristics of error in DEMs by identifying suitable quantitative measures and visualisation processes that may be enabled within a GIS. These are evaluated by contour threading a fractal surface and comparing four different spatial interpolations of the contours. The most effective error characterisations are found to be those that identify high frequency spatial pattern. Visualisation of spatial arrangement of DEM error is used to develop a deterministic error model based on local surface slope and aspect. DEMs are parameterised using first and second derivatives of quadratic surfaces fitted over a range of scales. This offers advantages over traditional methods based on a 3 by 3 local window, as geomorphometric form can be characterised at any scale. Morphometric parameters are combined to give a feature classification that may also be applied over a range of scales. Multi-scale measurements are combined to give a feature membership function that describes how properties change with scale. These functions are visualised using modal and entropy measures of variability. An additional method of visualising scale dependency is suggested that graphically represents statistical measures of spatial pattern over a variety of spatial lags. This is found most appropriate for detecting structural anisotropy in a surface. Characterisation tools are evaluated by applying them to uncorrelated surfaces, fractal surfaces and Ordnance Survey DEMs of Lake District, Peak District and Dartmoor.},

	abstract = {This study deals with the possibilities of expertdrivensemi-automated recognition of planation surfacesand other flat landforms in the area of the Aggtelek Karst,Hungary. Planation surfaces are the most debatable andvague landforms and can be defined as parts of terrainformed by long-lasting erosion-denudation processes underthe stagnant erosion base conditions. In terms of denudationchronology they can be considered as morphologicalindicators of different evolution stages of area. Inkarst areas planation surfaces and river terraces are mostlycorrelated with cave levels, which originated in relation tothe same stagnant erosion base. Because there is no generalmethod of delineation of planation surfaces, the mainobjective of the study was to find a suitable method forsemi-automated recognition of flat landforms in the AggtelekKarst, which should correspond to different phasesof the Jósva River incision and therefore could be correlatedto the multilevel cave system of the study area.Several methods for semi-automated landform classificationwere tested for recognition of flat surfaces in a relativelyobjective way. Slope gradient thresholding tool, andr.param.scale and r.geomorphon modules implemented inGRASS GIS were tested. As a result, the r.geomorphonmodule was proven as the most suitable method for delineationof relatively flat surfaces. Findings of the presentedwork can be used as a morphological indicator ofthe comprehensive reconstruction of evolution of the AggtelekKarst and the Slovak Karst.},

	abstract = {The progressive degradation of the cryosphere of High-Arctic areas causes an increase in the dynamics of geomorphic processes that shape the valleys of rapidly retreating glaciers. Those especially sensitive to global environmental changes are the small, land-ending valley glaciers that are in the phase of strong retreat. Under these conditions, the river valley's floors that are drained by proglacial waters are constantly undergoing intensive changes. For the analysis of these changes, two methods were used simultaneously (as a synthesis) to allow for quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The first one is the increasingly more common DoD method (DEM of difference), which allows quantifying volumetric changes as a result of topographic differentiation. The second one, which was applied for the first time on a small-valley spatial scale, is the geomorphons method that makes it possible to assess the stability of landforms and to determine the directions of their new development. To judge the applicability (advantages and disadvantages) of both methods for analysis of geomorphic changes in rapidly changing proglacial environments, the study was carried out over a 3.3 km distance of the non-glaciated section of the Scott River valley course (NW Wedel-Jarlsberg Land, SW Svalbard). This area (1.3 km2) is currently shaped by a braided gravel-bed river. More accurately, the study focused on the section spanning from the glacier terminus, which is the source of the Scott River, to its outlet at the Rechersche Fjord (Bellsundfiorden). The foundation for the development of comparative elevation models was a collection of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys that were taken with a Leica ScanStation C10 scanner during the 2010 and 2013 snowmelt seasons. On the basis of these surveys and with the use of TIN interpolation, high-resolution (0.2 m) digital terrain models (DTMs) were generated. The DTM models that had been prepared in this manner were used for the analysis of surface changes by employing Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) software, and by simultaneously generating geomorphons maps for four selected test areas that covered characteristic fragments of the valley bottom (1- on the close forefield of the Scott Glacier terminus; 2- in the immediate vicinity of the narrow valley outlet at the foot of the marginal moraine ridge; 3- in the enlargement of the central section of the non-glaciated valley floor; 4- within the alluvial fan (outlet to the fjord)). A comparison of the obtained results (DoD and geomorphons maps; zonal statistics) as well as a compilation of both the quantitative assessment of the scale of changes and the qualitative assessment of the transformation's direction allowed for reconstructing the range and rate of three-year-long changes in morphology at the analysed sections of the valley floor. It was found that the pattern and rate of changes were closely related to the location of the test areas in the Scott River's catchment system. Significant differences in the dynamics of processes shaping the valley landforms along the longitudinal valley course were found.},

	abstract = {This investigation focused on remotely detecting beaver impoundments and dams along the boreal-like peatland ecotones enmeshing Cranberry Glades Botanical Area, a National Natural Landmark in mountainous West Virginia, USA. Beaver (Castor spp.) are renowned for their role as ecosystem engineers. They can alter local hydrology, change the ratios of meadow to woodland, act as buffers against drought and wildfire, and influence important climate parameters such as carbon retention and methanogenesis. The Cranberry Glades ({\textasciitilde}1000 m a.s.l.) occupy {\textasciitilde}300 ha, including {\textasciitilde}40 ha of regionally rare, open peatlands. Given the likely historical role of beaver activity in the formation and maintenance of peatland conditions at Cranberry Glades, monitoring of recent activity may be useful in predicting future changes. We analyzed remotely sensed data to identify and reconstruct shifting patterns of surface hydrology associated with beaver ponds and dams and developed a novel application of geomorphons to detect them, aided by exploitation of absences and errors in Lidar data. We also quantified decadal-timescale dynamics of beaver activity by tallying detectable active impoundments between 1990–2020, revealing active/fallow cycles and changing numbers of impoundments per unit area of suitable riparian habitat. This research presents both a practical approach to monitoring beaver activity through analysis of publicly available data and a spatiotemporal reconstruction of three decades of beaver activity at this rare and imperiled “Arctic Island” of the southern High Alleghenies.},

	abstract = {Automatic procedures for landform extraction is a growing research field but extensive quantitative studies of the prediction accuracy of Automatic Landform Classification (ACL) based on a direct comparison with geomorphological maps are rather limited. In this work, we test the accuracy of an algorithm of automatic landform classification on a large sector of the Ionian coast of the southern Italian belt through a quantitative comparison with a detailed geomorphological map. Automatic landform classification was performed by using an algorithm based on the individuation of basic landform classes named geomorphons. Spatial overlay between the main mapped landforms deriving from traditional geomorphological analysis and the automatic landform classification results highlighted a satisfactory percentage of accuracy (higher than 70\%) of the geomorphon-based method for the coastal plain area and drainage network. The percentage of accuracy decreased by about 20–30\% for marine and fluvial terraces, while the overall accuracy of the ACL map is 69\%. Our results suggest that geomorphon-based classification could represent a basic and robust tool to recognize the main geomorphological elements of landscape at a large scale, which can be useful for the advanced steps of geomorphological mapping such as genetic interpretation of landforms and detailed delineation of complex and composite geomorphic elements.},
